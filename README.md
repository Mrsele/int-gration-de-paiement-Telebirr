Prerequisites
Ethio Telecom Developer Account: Sign up on the Ethio Telecom Developer Portal.
API Credentials: Register your application on the portal to obtain your appId and appKey.
Server Setup: Have a backend server capable of making HTTP requests and handling webhook callbacks.
Getting Started
Register on the developer portal and obtain your credentials:

appId: Unique identifier for your app.
appKey: Secret key for authenticating API requests.
Set up environment variables for your API credentials:

bash
Copy code
export TELEBIRR_APP_ID="your_app_id"
export TELEBIRR_APP_KEY="your_app_key"
Integration Steps
1. Authenticate
The Telebirr API requires an accessToken for each session. Use the /oauth2/token endpoint to generate this token. Tokens may expire periodically, so ensure you handle token renewal.

Request:

http
Copy code
POST /oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "appId": "your_app_id",
  "appKey": "your_app_key"
}
Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "accessToken": "your_access_token",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
2. Initiate Payment
To start a payment, call the /api/payment/initiate endpoint with details of the transaction.

Request:

http
Copy code
POST /api/payment/initiate
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
{
  "appId": "your_app_id",
  "outTradeNo": "unique_transaction_id",
  "subject": "Payment for Order #1234",
  "totalAmount": "100.00",
  "notifyUrl": "https://your-server.com/callback",
  "returnUrl": "https://your-app.com/payment-complete"
}
Parameters:

outTradeNo: Unique ID for this transaction.
totalAmount: Amount to be paid.
notifyUrl: Callback URL for Telebirr to notify upon payment completion.
returnUrl: URL where the user is redirected post-payment.
3. Query Payment Status
Check the status of a payment using the outTradeNo from the initiate payment request.

Request:

http
Copy code
GET /api/payment/query?outTradeNo=unique_transaction_id
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
Response: The response contains the payment status and details, useful for confirming successful transactions.

4. Handle Callbacks
Implement a listener on your notifyUrl endpoint to handle payment notifications from Telebirr. Verify the data to confirm if the payment was successful.

Example Code
Hereâ€™s an example of initiating a payment using Node.js and Express.

javascript
Copy code
const axios = require('axios');

const TELEBIRR_APP_ID = process.env.TELEBIRR_APP_ID;
const TELEBIRR_APP_KEY = process.env.TELEBIRR_APP_KEY;

async function authenticate() {
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.telebirr.com/oauth2/token', {
    appId: TELEBIRR_APP_ID,
    appKey: TELEBIRR_APP_KEY
  });
  return response.data.accessToken;
}

async function initiatePayment(transactionId, amount) {
  const accessToken = await authenticate();
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.telebirr.com/api/payment/initiate',
    {
      appId: TELEBIRR_APP_ID,
      outTradeNo: transactionId,
      subject: `Order Payment #${transactionId}`,
      totalAmount: amount,
      notifyUrl: 'https://your-server.com/callback',
      returnUrl: 'https://your-app.com/payment-complete'
    },
    { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}` } }
  );
  return response.data;
}
Callback Example
Set up a route on your server to listen for payment notifications:

javascript
Copy code
app.post('/callback', (req, res) => {
  const paymentData = req.body;
  // Process and verify the payment
  if (paymentData.status === 'SUCCESS') {
    console.log('Payment successful:', paymentData);
  }
  res.status(200).send('Callback received');
});
